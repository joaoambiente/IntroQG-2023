# Exercise 5: Viscous flow of ice (20 points)

Most landforms on Earth are sculpted by the flow of fluids across the landscape. Erosion by glaciers can significantly change the Earth's surface, moving vast quantities of material from high elevations to lower elevations. Glacial landscapes are unique and clearly reflect erosion by processes that differ greatly from those found in fluvial systems. To understand how material is moved within glacial systems, it is important to first understand the dominant controls on glacial flow velocities.

## Attribution

This exercise is based on a MATLAB exercise from [Prof. Todd Ehlers (University of Glasgow)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/ges/staff/toddehlers/).

## Completing the exercise

- **Exercise 5 is due by 14:15 on Monday December 4th 2023**.
- **Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change**!

## Where to find help

- Review the [materials for Lesson 5](https://introqg-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L5/overview.html)
- Check out the [hints for this week's exercise](https://introqg-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L5/exercise-5.html#general-hints-for-exercise-5) if you're having trouble
- Take a look at the **[PEP 8 - Style guide for Python code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)** if you are uncertain about **the style of your code**

## Before you start

### Clone the Exercise 5 repository

Before starting to work with the problems for this week, you should start a new JupyterLab instance and clone your own Exercise 5 repository (e.g., `exercise-5-davewhipp`) in the instance using Git. If you are unaware of how to do this, you can find instruction in [**Lesson 2 of the Geo-Python course**](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/git-basics.html#clone-a-repository-from-github).
