# Exercise 3: Diffusion and Dodson's equations (20 points)

The goal of this week's exercise is to explore the diffusion equation and how it can be applied to interpret mineral cooling ages measured using thermochronology. We'll start with exploring the diffusion equation in general and then move to Dodson's equations and how they can be applied to calculate an effective closure temperature for a thermochronometer. As a reminder, the effective closure temperature is the temperature the mineral at the time of its age.

## Completing the exercise

- **Exercise 3 is due by 14:15 on Monday November 20th 2023**.
- **Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change**!

## Where to find help

- Review the [materials for Lesson 3](https://introqg-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L3/overview.html)
- Check out the [hints for this week's exercise](https://introqg-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L3/exercise-3.html#general-hints-for-exercise-3) if you're having trouble
- Take a look at the **[PEP 8 - Style guide for Python code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)** if you are uncertain about **the style of your code**

## Before you start

### Clone the Exercise 3 repository

Before starting to work with the problems for this week, you should start a new JupyterLab instance and clone your own Exercise 3 repository (e.g., `exercise-3-davewhipp`) in the instance using Git. If you are unaware of how to do this, you can find instruction in [**Lesson 2 of the Geo-Python course**](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/git-basics.html#clone-a-repository-from-github).
