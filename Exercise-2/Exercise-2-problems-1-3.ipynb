As a reminder, you will be working with a climate data file from the [US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) climate database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/). In order to jump right into things, we have provided you with [a data file that has already been processed](data/seasonal-temps.csv) containing the means and standard deviations of seasonal temperatures (in Celsius) for winter and summer for the years 1953-2019. The first 5 lines of the data file are:\n",

    "1. Based on the least-squares regressions calculated in Problem 1, how have summer and winter temperatures changed in Helsinki over the time 1953-2019? Is the trend similar for both seasons? What about when you consider only the data over the last 20 years? Do you have any first-hand experience that relates to these temperature trends? If so, what?\n",
    "2. Based on the calculation of the correlation coefficients in Problem 2, how well does it seem the data are fit by a line? Are there any significant differences between seasons or time periods in the calculated $r$ values?\n",
    "3. Looking at the goodness-of-fit values calculated in Problem 3, how well does it appear the data are fit by a regression line? Do you see differences between seasons ot time period considered? \n",
    "4. Comparing the calculated $\\chi^{2}$ values from Problem 3 to the $r$ values in Problem 2, what differences do you see in the numbers between seasons and/or time periods? Can you think of reasons why the $r$ and $\\chi^{2}$ values might differ in terms of their relative values in each season/time period? How are the $r$ and $\\chi^{2}$ values different in terms of what they measure?"
