# Exercise 1: Coding and visualizing geostatistics (20 points)

## Motivation

This week's exercise is built around two things we all face at some point in our careers as geoscientists: Statistics and clueless family members. For the first item, we'll focus on converting a few common statistical equations to Python code and using them to analyze some data. For item two, imagine the following scene:

> Period II finally ends and Christmas break is here. While sitting at a family get-together, you're enjoying thoughts of being away from the university for a few weeks. Suddenly, a clueless family member addresses you:
>
> **Uncle Ismo**: So, I hear you've been away learning all about rocks at the university. You know, I've always been fascinated by volcanoes.
> 
> **You**: *\<sigh\>* Yes, Uncle Ismo... Volcanoes are very interesting. (You hope that is enough to get him to leave you alone).
> 
> **Uncle Ismo**: Hey, since you know so much about rocks now, why don't you tell me a few things about volcanoes. Might be fun to use some of that big brain of yours. Let's start with something easy...how tall is the average volcano?
> 
> **You**: (How humiliating...you don't know). Well, probably a few kilometers above sea level or something. Are you excited the Raide-Jokeri is finally open? That was quite a project. (You hope changing the subject will steer your uncle away from poking fun at you for not knowing something geological. Unfortunately, he is not interested in city stuff, and notices you trying to change the subject).
> 
> **Uncle Ismo**: Who cares about some fancy tram, it seems like you don't know what you're talking about. Why bother spending all that time studying if you aren't learning anything? (Uncle Ismo seems unaware that volcano elevations are not really the focal point of geology studies. Nonetheless, this is an embarrassing situation, and one it would be nice to avoid).
> 
> **You**: ...

In order to avoid such situations, we'll apply our Python skills to analyze Holocene volcano data from the [Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program](https://volcano.si.edu/). In our analysis, we'll learn how to use our Python equations to calculate the mean, standard deviation, and standard error of subsets of volcanoes. Afterward, awkward situations with Uncle Ismo (at least those related to geology) will be easy to solve with a few lines of Python code.

## Completing the exercise

- **Exercise 1 is due by the start of the next lesson (14:15 on 6 November 2023)**.
- **Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change**!

## Where to find help

- Review the [materials for Lesson 1](https://introqg-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L1/overview.html)
- Check out the [hints for this week's exercise](https://introqg-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L1/exercise-1.html#general-hints-for-exercise-1) if you're having trouble
- Take a look at the **[PEP 8 - Style guide for Python code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)** if you are uncertain about **the style of your code**

## Before you start

### Clone the Exercise 1 repository

Before starting to work with the problems for this week, you should start a new JupyterLab instance and clone your own Exercise 1 repository (e.g., `exercise-1-davewhipp`) in the instance using Git. If you are unaware of how to do this, you can find instruction in [**Lesson 2 of the Geo-Python course**](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/git-basics.html#clone-a-repository-from-github).
