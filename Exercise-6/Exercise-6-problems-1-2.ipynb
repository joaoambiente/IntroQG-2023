    "The overall goal of this exercise is to create a model for calculating thermochronometer ages as a function of the advection velocity in a 1D thermal model in order to try to find the long-term exhumation rate that best fits a set of measured ages. We are going to assume that erosion balances any potential uplift of the Earth's surface such that the advection velocity in the thermal model will be equivalent to the long-term exhumation rate. An overview of how we can go about calculating thermochronometer ages from a thermal model is given below. Items in italics will be handled in Exercise 7.\n",

Well, the reason we need this additional function is that we now have a thermal history with a cooling rate that might vary over time, and we need to ensure we are using the cooling rate that applies at the time when the rock parcel is cooling through the effective closure temperature. We can create our function as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating the function**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you should create a new function in your `introqg_functions.py` script file called `calculate_closure_temps()`. In the function, you will pass in the following values, and you should use the same name for the parameters in your `calculate_closure_temps()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `time_history` (Array of time values. **Note**: Time here is thermal model time, not time in millions of years ago; units: Myr)\n",
    "- `temp_history` (Array of temperature values ; units: °C)\n",
    "- `calc_ahe` (Calculate apatite (U-Th)/He closure temperature?; `True` or `False`)\n",
    "- `calc_zhe` (Calculate zircon (U-Th)/He closure temperature?; `True` or `False`)\n",
    "- `calc_mar` (Calculate muscovite Ar/Ar closure temperature?; `True` or `False`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start by setting the effective closure temperature to `None` for the thermochronometers we will consider\n",
    "    - We will use the apatite (U-Th)/He, zircon (U-Th)/He, and muscovite Ar/Ar thermochronometers\n",
    "    - In your function, I suggest using variable names such as `final_ahe_tc` for storing the closure temperature for the apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronometer, and similar names for other thermochronometers\n",
    "- Next, you can calculate an array of cooling rates for the thermal history you created using the `calculate_temp_history()` function\n",
    "    - First, calculate the time increment between values in the time history as the absolute value of the difference between the first two times in the time history array. This will ensure the time increment is a positive number.\n",
    "    - After that, you can create an array of cooling rates using the `np.gradient()` function. In our case, we will use the temperatures as the source array along with the time increment in order to calculate the changes in temperature with time (i.e., the cooling rates). Check out the [np.gradient documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.gradient.html) to see how to use this function.\n",
    "- Finally, you will again use a `for` loop to iterate over all of the values in the time history and calculate the effective closure temperatures\n",
    "    - You should again use a `for` loop along with the `range(len())` construct to iterate over the values in the time history array\n",
    "    - Once inside the loop, you should ensure that the cooling rate is at least 0.1 °C/Myr in each iteration by taking the minimum of the cooling rate at index `i` in your cooling rates array and the value `-0.1`. You can use the `min()` function for this. Because the cooling rates will be negative, the minimum function will find the larger negative value. You can assign the output from the `min()` function to a variable such as `cooling_rate_min` and use that for your closure temperature calculations.\n",
    "    - Now that you have a suitable cooling rate in the loop, you can use your `dodson()` function to calculate closure temperatures\n",
    "        - Only calculate a closure temperature if the corresponding boolean variable (`calc_ahe`, for example) is `True`\n",
    "        - If so, call the `dodson()` function using the adjusted cooling rate (i.e., `cooling_rate_min` for the cooling rate) and with the correct parameters for the given thermochronometer (see Table 1 below). You can store the output in an appropriate variable, such as `ahe_tc`.\n",
    "        - After calculating the effective closure temperature, you should check to see whether that closure temperature is lower than the current temperature in the temperature history array for this iteration\n",
    "            - If yes, then store the newly calculated closure temperature with a variable name such as `final_ahe_tc`\n",
    "            - This will ensure that the closure temperature that is stored will only be updated while the temperature in the temperature history is above the effective closure temperature\n",
    "        - You can repeat the preceding steps for the other two remaining thermochronometers being sure to calculate the effective closure temperature only if the passed `calc_zhe` or `calc_mar` parameter variable is `True` and storing the \"final\" closure temperature only when the temperature in the temperature history is above the calculated closure temperature\n",
    "- After calculating the closure temperatures, you can return all three \"final values\" (e.g., `final_ahe_tc`) in a single `return` statement\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have a closure temperature for our thermochronometers of interest, we can move on to calculating a thermochronometer age using that closure temperature. Compared to the previous function, this will be quite straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we have a thermal history from the combination of depth-time and temperature values, and a closure temperature. In order to calculate an age, we simply need to determine the time at which we reach the effective closure temperature in the thermal history. We will do this using a linear interpolation of the thermal history, as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating the function**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you should create a new function in your `introqg_functions.py` script file called `calculate_age()`. In the function, you will pass in the following values, and you should use the same name for the parameters in your `calculate_age()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `time_history` (Array of time values. **Note**: Time here is thermal model time, not time in millions of years ago; units: Myr)\n",
    "- `temp_history` (Array of temperature values ; units: °C)\n",
    "- `closure_temp` (The closure temperature; units: °C)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a linear interpolation function to find the time at which the closure temperature is reached in the thermal history\n",
    "    - We will use the NumPy function `np.interp()` for this interpolation. The `np.interp()` function accepts 3 values (at least) to find the interpolated value. The values in our case would be the closure temperature, the temperature history array, and finally the time history array. You can read more about the `np.interp()` function in the [NumPy documentation online](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.interp.html).\n",
    "        - **Note**: One challenge with the `np.interp()` function is that it requires the array of temperatures to be in increasing order, rather than decreasing as we have it now. You can use the `np.flip()` function to reverse the order of the items in the temperature history when you do the interpolation. You can find more information about the `np.flip()` function in the [NumPy documentation online](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.flip.html).\n",
    "            - **Note**: The approach of flipping the temperature history described above allows us to use a nice \"trick\" here. We have a time array that is in increasing order from 0.0 Myr at the start of the thermal history to some final value (50 Myr, for example), but thermochronometer ages are normally reported as the number of millions of years ago (Ma). Normally, we would convert from our time history values (starting from 0.0) to millions of years ago by subtracting the interpolated age from the highest value in the time history, which would give a time in millions of years ago. However, in this case by interpolating with a flipped temperature array without flipping the time history, the value we get for the interpolated age will be in millions of years ago already. Cool!\n",
