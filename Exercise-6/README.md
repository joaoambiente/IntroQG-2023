# Exercise 6: Building a thermochronology model (20 points)

In our exercise this week we will bring together many of the topics we have addressed in earlier exercises in this course in order to calculate thermochronometer ages using temperature histories generated from a crustal heat transfer model. This might sound like a difficult task, but in fact we have already completed many of the most challenging parts of creating such a model, and now we simply need to put those pieces together.

## Completing the exercise

- **Exercise 6 is due by 17:00 on Wednesday December 13th, 2023**.
- **Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change**!

## Where to find help

- Review the [materials for Lesson 6](https://introqg-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L6/overview.html)
- Check out the [hints for this week's exercise](https://introqg-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L6/exercise-6.html) if you're having trouble
- Take a look at the **[PEP 8 - Style guide for Python code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)** if you are uncertain about **the style of your code**

## Before you start

### Clone the Exercise 6 repository

Before starting to work with the problems for this week, you should start a new JupyterLab instance and clone your own Exercise 6 repository (e.g., `exercise-6-davewhipp`) in the instance using Git. If you are unaware of how to do this, you can find instruction in [**Lesson 2 of the Geo-Python course**](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/git-basics.html#clone-a-repository-from-github).
